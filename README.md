## Features
- âœ… Checks password length and complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
- âœ… Rates password as **Strong**, **Moderate**, or **Weak**.
- âœ… Calculates password **entropy** (security strength in bits).
- âœ… Verifies if the password has been leaked in known data breaches.
- âœ… Provides detailed feedback on missing elements.
- âœ… Suggests strong, random passwords if the entered password is weak.

## How it Works

- The password is evaluated for:
  - Minimum length (8 characters).
  - Presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- Password is **hashed with SHA-1** and checked against the [Pwned Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords).
- Displays whether your password is **safe** or has been **compromised**.

Would you like a strong password suggestion? (yes/no): yes
Here is a suggested strong password: Xr9@eL!2v#Pt

##**Output**
Enter a password to check: Example@123
Password is strong.
âœ… Password not found. Good to go!
Password entropy: 75.56 bits.
