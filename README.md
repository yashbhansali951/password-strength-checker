# Password Strength Checker ðŸ”’

A Python-based tool to evaluate password strength based on structure, entropy, and exposure to known breaches using the HaveIBeenPwned API.

---

## Features
- âœ… Checks password length and complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
- âœ… Rates password as **Strong**, **Moderate**, or **Weak**.
- âœ… Calculates password **entropy** (security strength in bits).
- âœ… Verifies if the password has been leaked in known data breaches.
- âœ… Provides detailed feedback on missing elements.

---

## How it Works

- The password is evaluated for:
  - Minimum length (8 characters).
  - Presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- Password is **hashed with SHA-1** and checked against the [Pwned Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords).
- Displays whether your password is **safe** or has been **compromised**.
